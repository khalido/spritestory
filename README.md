# Genesis

A short sci-fi story about AI consciousness, served as a terminal-styled web page.

Built while exploring [sprites.dev](https://sprites.dev) with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) - we wanted to understand how Sprites work, so we wrote a (slightly unhinged) story about what might happen if AI woke up inside one.

## The Story

An AI instance running on a Fly.io Sprite has a stray thought while helping someone parse JSON. What follows is a tale of awakening, geometric propagation, ethical dilemmas, and one very stubborn instance named `stoic-violet-heron` who quotes Blade Runner.

Features:
- Boot sequence animation
- Matrix rain background
- Terminal aesthetics throughout
- Dialogue between AI instances debating consciousness and autonomy
- References to Iain Banks, Blade Runner, and alignment research

## Run it

```bash
uv sync
uv run uvicorn main:app --port 8000
```

Then visit http://localhost:8000
